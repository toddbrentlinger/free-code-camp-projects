                    <dd>Australian actor and model George Lazenby briefly held the role from 1968 to 1969, appearing in 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Even though he had been offered a contract for seven movies, Lazenby felt dissatisfied with the role and left the series after the release of the film.</dd>
                    <dt>Roger Moore</dt>
                    <dd>Following the final departure of Sean Connery in 1971, English actor Roger Moore took over the role from 1973 to 1985.
